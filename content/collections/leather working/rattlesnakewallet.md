### Why Leather Working?

I was introduced to leather working years ago when I visited Tandy Leather with my dad. He had previously stumbled upon it and thought it was a cool store. I’ve been designing my own leather goods and crafting them by hand ever since. 

**Objectives for Each Project:**
The majority of my projects are gifts for friends and family during the holidays. Each time I start a new project I try to design something which fits the person’s functional and aesthetic needs. Finally I implement a new skill or technique I’ve recently learned about. This process allows me to improve my craftsmanship with every project I complete, which is evident in my portfolio.

### Description ###
Designed as an upgrade to the previous wallet I made for my dad. The original was one of my first ever leather working projects. It included rattlesnake skin from a snake which was killed near our house. This skin was saved and transffered to the new wallet along with some more from another snake. Aesthetics and ruggedness were preferred over slim factor in this design. 

Every project starts with an idea and a few sketches. Decide on a color scheme and design a mock model in cardstock for particularly complex designs. Then these cardstock templates can be cut used to cut out the leather peices and saved for future itterations or replicas of projects.
