## The Task

Working as an intern at [Turner Engineering Corp.](https://turner-engineering.com/) I was tasked with creating wiring schematics and box renders for a bus communication proposal. Although not a part of my job description as "test asset manager" I had demonstrated my skills for CAD on a previous project report, and they proved a valuable asset for the project.
