## "Ender 3-Up" Open Source Project Proposal ##
In the future I plan to combine the whole system as an open source project for the Ender 3. The goals of this project would be to make a lightweight, high cooling, direct drive extruder for the Ender 3 and similar systems. The plug and go design would allow users to easily upgrade their older printers to compete with the rapidly advancing print speeds and quality of modern FDM printers.
